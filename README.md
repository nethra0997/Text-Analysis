# Text-Analysis
This project demonstrates various techniques for analyzing textual data using Python. It includes data loading, text visualization, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER). The project utilizes libraries such as pandas, plotly, WordCloud, matplotlib, TextBlob, spaCy, and sklearn to perform comprehensive text analysis.

## Imports:
Libraries used include pandas, plotly.express, WordCloud, matplotlib.pyplot, TextBlob, spacy, and sklearn.
Essential imports are shown for handling data manipulation, visualization, sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and topic modeling.

## Data Loading:
The notebook uses a CSV file named "articles.csv" 

## Word Cloud Creation:
Titles from the articles are combined into a single string.
Created a WordCloud object and visualized using plotly.express.

## Sentiment Analysis:
Calculated the sentiment polarity for each article using TextBlob.
Created a histogram to display the distribution of sentiment scores across the articles.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER):
Placeholder for NER function, indicating further processing of text to extract named entities using spaCy.


# Usage:
Modify the code to use your own dataset or to extend the analysis.
Explore different visualization techniques and text processing methods.
# Visualizations:
Word Cloud of Article Titles
Histogram of Sentiment Scores
