# Text-Analysis
This project demonstrates various techniques for analyzing textual data using Python. It includes data loading, text visualization, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER). The project utilizes libraries such as pandas, plotly, WordCloud, matplotlib, TextBlob, spaCy, and sklearn to perform comprehensive text analysis.

## Imports:
Libraries used include pandas, plotly.express, WordCloud, matplotlib.pyplot, TextBlob, spacy, and sklearn.
Essential imports are shown for handling data manipulation, visualization, sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and topic modeling.

## Data Loading:
The notebook loads a CSV file named "articles.csv" and prints the first few rows of the dataset.

## Word Cloud Creation:
Titles from the articles are combined into a single string.
A WordCloud object is created and visualized using plotly.express.

## Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment polarity is calculated for each article using TextBlob.
A histogram is created to display the distribution of sentiment scores across the articles.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER):
Placeholder for NER function, indicating further processing of text to extract named entities using spaCy.
